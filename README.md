- FMI 1.0 and 2.0
- Model Exchange and Co-Simulation
- Rapid Accelerator mode
- import of C code FMUs
- MATLAB R2012b - R2019b

## Quick start

To get started with FMI Kit run the following commands in the MATLAB Command Window

```matlab
% download and extract the distribution archive to the current folder
unzip(['https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMIKit-Simulink/releases/' ...
  'download/v2.7/FMIKit-Simulink-2.7.zip'], 'FMIKit-Simulink')

% add the folder to the MATLAB path
addpath(fullfile(pwd, 'FMIKit-Simulink-2.7'))

% initialize FMI Kit
FMIKit.initialize()

% open the Bouncing Ball demo
fmikit_demo_BouncingBall

% open the documentation
web('FMIKit-Simulink-2.7/html/index.html')
```

See the documentation to learn how to [import](docs/fmu_import.md) and [export](docs/fmu_export.md) FMUs.
