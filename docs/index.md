FMI Kit is a Simulink toolbox to import and export Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) that conform to the [FMI&nbsp;Standard](https://fmi-standard.org/).
It provides an S-Function with a graphical user interface and a MATLAB API that can import existing binary or C code FMUs into Simulink and set parameters and options.
It also contains two TLC targets for [Simulink&nbsp;Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html) to export Simulink models as FMUs that can be imported into [170+](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) third-party applications that support FMI.
FMI Kit supports...

- FMI 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0
- Model Exchange and Co-Simulation
- MATLAB R2016a - R2022a
