## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Validate your code** &mdash; ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.

2. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `develop` branch in the repository.

4. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
What is your environment?
What steps will reproduce the issue?

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the MATLAB/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.

> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
